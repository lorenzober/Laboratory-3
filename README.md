# Laboratory-3

## Task 1.
Create a class with attributes and a constructor. In the main() method, initialize the creation of instances of the class and demonstrate the operation of its methods according to the conditions of the task.
Compose a class description for a vector given by the coordinates of its ends in three-dimensional space. Provide vector addition and subtraction operations with the creation of a new vector (sum or difference), 
calculation of the scalar product of two vectors, the length of the vector, the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Make class properties private, and create getter methods to read them.

## Task 2
In the previous task, create two methods using JSON serialization and deserialization.
Method 1. Saves the created class object from Task 1 to a JSON file
Method 2: Opens a JSON file with data and creates a class object with the data to perform Task 1.
